(making a new website yall)

I have been making websites for a number of years using wordpress. I started going totally minimilist and made a few sites with just 2 files (html + css), but this didn't do all thing things I wanted. So, I've decided to make things simple and try out github pages using ruby + jekyll. To start with I am making a new portfolio site. This is my "test" site which I will (hopefully soon) make into my portfolio.
